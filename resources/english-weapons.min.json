But cold-blooded creatures ever seek the promised land of warmth.\nTo see his people's dreams fulfilled, Omikami challenged the gathering storm clouds to war.\nAmongst the people of Watatsumi bent upon conquest, a young man stood out from the rest.\nHis fearless valor won him great love in Watatsumi, and they named him Touzannou.\nBut after many years passed, his kingly name was forgotten, only to be replaced by the epithet by which his foes knew him:\n\"Akuou,\" the wicked fangs and claws of the Great Serpent, the savage, demonic invader of Yashiori Island...\n\nThe slaughter had hardened the young man into a warrior. But to him,\nOnly the wish he made before departing, a wish made upon the moon reflected in the waters beside the shrine, was eternal.\n\n\"One day, I shall set myself above Mt. Yougou, overlooking the palace of the Lord of Thunder.\"\n\"I will have a joyful showdown against the legendary Great Tengu of Yougou upon the roof of Tenshukaku.\"\n\"...And then I'll bring that tengu's mask back to Ayame and Mouun as a souvenir!\"\n\nAt last, the tides washed all their dreams away like towers in the sand.\nThe tengu's mask, shining like a crimson star, was shattered like seashore gravel amidst the chaotic battle,\nNor would the shrine maiden who shone like moonlight into the young man's soul ever return again,\nWhile the Akuou himself would face the blinding ray of lightning alongside the Great Serpent.",

It is said that its edge was so sharp that it might even cut through mortal fate.\nAs for the overly lengthy name, it is said that Iwakura Douin specified to Amenoma that it be called as such.",

They sang of the stories that blossomed brilliantly like a field of flowers,\nBringing courage, hope, and happiness to the children who had never had the chance to witness a dream,\nWeaving a never-ending song of a thousand nights, lighting up the moments before the long-awaited daybreak.\n\nAfter traversing a thousand dreams, until the nightingale no longer sang, until the fading sun fell beneath the horizon once again,\nThe traveler saw at journey's end that verdant lamp, that faraway homeland of old,\nWhere the dew-covered rose still swayed softly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for her to tell a new story:\n\"Though the memories of past nights have all but faded, we shall continue to sing songs of praise for the sweet dreams that have yet to unfold.\"",

The Cor Purum seems to wax and wane like a crimson moon, growing steadily brighter and then steadily darker in a never-ending cycle.\n\n\"The myriad mountains of Tianheng are a trove of a thousand treasures, for deep within the rocks bounteous jade gleams gloriously.\" This is to say, mining prospered in Liyue under Rex Lapis' rule.\nOne by one the ore deposits in Mt. Tianheng and the surrounding area would run dry, and the miners would dig further. The result was a network of mine shafts stretching across the region in all directions. At their deepest point, the mines reached all the way to the earth's core.\nSlowly, the once-quiet region was beset by increasingly frequent disturbances. With a deep growl, the earth would tremble, causing landslides on the mountains and cave-ins in the mines.\nIn the night, the aggrieved souls of the innocent who died in the disasters could be heard wailing in the distance.\n\nThen one day, a stranger arrived at Mt. Qingce.\nThe stranger was dressed in a full-length gown and spoke in an esoteric and eloquent manner. He claimed to be a thaumaturge visiting Liyue on a quest to find two craftsmen by the names of Yun and Han.\nYun Huang, the first daughter of the Yun family, was then resident in Qingce Village. She immediately sent a messenger to fetch Han Ce, first son of master craftsman Han Wu.\nThe thaumaturge informed them both that in the past, the Yuns and Hans had jointly crafted a catalyst for the thaumaturges of the world.\nWith unrest now spreading through Liyue, the thaumaturges wished to provide the Yuns and Hans with a piece of crimson Cor Purum, in the hope that it might help the people of Liyue through this troubled time.\n\nOn receiving the message, Yun Huang and Han Ce lit the furnace at once and crafted a blackcliff catalyst with the crimson Pur Lapis at its core.\nThe crimson stone resonated with the ley lines of the earth. A blood-red glow would fade in and out as if to give forewarning of imminent tectonic activity.\nJust as the stars guide those who travel by night, so this catalyst was the light that gave safe passage to the people of Liyue through that tumultuous time of landslides and cave-ins. It was placed at the foot of Mt. Tianheng for all to see.\nWhen peaceful days finally returned, the Blackcliff Agate quietly disappeared without a trace, just as had faded the fury of the earth's core.",

But it is one that the bladesmith must overcome if he is to free himself from the shackles that bind him and reach new heights of competency in his trade.\nHan Wu struggled to see beyond the limits of his casting techniques. Thanks to a contact of his good friend in the house of Yun, he was able to go with a crew to the Chasm to personally procure the materials for his new weapon.\nBut a cave-in trapped the crew in the mine shaft for four days.\n\nImprisoned within the impenetrable rock walls of the cave, the crew found their mining tools to be of no use.\nDeprived of all natural light and thus of all knowledge as to the time of day, one by one the trapped crew succumbed to madness and despair.\nJust when they thought all hope was lost, Han Wu thought he saw a faint flickering emanate from the corner of the cave, where lay the prototype sword he had brought with him into the mine.\nWith that sword he carved their way to freedom, and the survivors emerged from the pits of the earth into glorious bright sunlight. But the moment that the first ray of sunlight made contact with the blade, it shattered into a million pieces.\nAll strength left the master craftsman's legs and he collapsed on the ground. Months later, he remade the sword and declared, \"This sword shall be named the Blackcliff Longsword, for it is made of blackcliff.\"\nAll who beheld the Blackcliff Longsword were bewitched by its beauty, spellbound by its sharpness, and transfixed by its tenacity.\nBut the crew spoke not a word of what they had witnessed during their ordeal in the mine...\n\nDeep in the all-consuming darkness, when the master craftsman struck his blade against the cave wall with all his might, the sword released a deafening roar, like thunder sweeping across the plains.\nPerhaps the crew knew that the sword's cry was to foreshadow an earthquake years into the future...",

It zaps through the air like lightning, unimpeded by the wind.\nMade from blackcliff crystal from head to tip, the body is inlaid with red jade stones for decoration.\nViewed in the moonlight, the swirling of blood-red light can be discerned within.\n\nLiyue master craftsman Han Wu had a son with his first wife. The son's name was \"Han Ce, the Cold and Calculating.\" Cold, because his father wished him to be cool-headed and rational. Calculating, because his father wished him to be precise in his craft, that he might inherit the family business.\nBut Han Ce had other ambitions. During his days as a student, Han Ce idled away his study time on martial arts fiction, while spending his free time practicing the art of the polearm up in the mountains. He was consumed by the desire to become a martial nomad, roaming the world with his pole for protection.\nWhen he scoured the lands in search of Aerosiderite, he sought not the rare ore itself but the thrill of adventure. And when he ascended the highest peaks to commune with the adepti, he desired not the wisdom of the sages but the tale of his travels.\nHan Ce cared not for the flames of the furnace and the working of weaponry. His father scolded him, but it was to no avail. Eventually, Han Ce left home one day without bidding his father farewell.\n\nIn his later years, Han Wu was involved in a mining accident that profoundly changed his temperament. Han Ce caught wind of the ordeal and hurried home to see his father, traveling through the night.\nPreviously hot-tempered and never short of something to say, Han Wu was now calm and quiet. He no longer held any animosity towards his son for his reluctance to take over the forge.\nFinally, father and son grew close for the first time in their lives. Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.\nSeveral years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of the master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study — they were the fabled prototypes.\nThe archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.\n\"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you.\"\n\nThe designs were covered in comments penned by his father. Han Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.\nAs Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.\nA host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, \"The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!\"\nHan Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.\nHan Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.",

Weighty as a boulder, it has enough brute force to carve its way through a mountain.\nThe blade is forged from a combination of blackcliff crystal and a crimson ore. It is pitch black like a pool of ink, with red flames leaping from within.\n\nBlackcliff weaponry has its roots in the ancient \"prototype\" series. Blackcliff blades possess three distinguishing features: hard as bedrock, shimmer like ice, fierce as the blood that gives us life.\nThough the Slasher is a broadsword, it has a uniquely sharp blade, barely thicker than a thread of silk.\nThe join between the red and black crystals is seamless, and each blade segment interlocks perfectly with the next to form a single cohesive body.\nWith the flame motif and red jade stones that adorn the hilt, the sword has a dark and foreboding presence when viewed from afar, like bright-red blood oozing from a bottomless pit of black ink.\n\nMaster craftsman Han Wu once embarked on a quest to find the finest ore with which to cast a blackcliff blade. He searched everywhere, until he became involved in a mining accident.\nWhile trapped in the cave, his eyes perceived nothing but an all-engulfing and profoundly disorienting darkness. His ears rang with the thunderous crashing of rocks, as if the foundations of the world itself were caving in.\nIn the aftermath of this ordeal, the craftsman's furnace lay unused. Where flames once burned bright, frigid dust now gathered as the forgotten fantasies of the forge dwindled and died.\nHan Wu's son, Han Ce, read that the earth's core had been sealed off due to a monster infestation, and rushed to inform his father.\nHan Wu was racked with guilt upon hearing the news. He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens. He forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.\nWhen it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft. There, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.\n\nHan Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.\nAt the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt. Tianheng saw a crimson light shining out from somewhere within the rocks. As the traveler watched on, a hidden shrine appeared and slowly opened.\nThe broadsword inside the shrine shone faintly, as if weeping with bereavement.\nHan Ce went into the mountains that very night to retrieve the blade.\nThe Tianshu of that age personally engraved an inscription upon the blade:\n\"Carves open mountains and tears through the seas, shreds apart clouds and splits the moon.\"",

Drawing the bow invokes a sound like the wind — a premonition of the final breeze for any target within 100 yards.\nWith a jet-black body contrasted by blood-red ends, it's cold to the touch without being intimidating. A shot from this bow takes to the skies like a meteor, challenging both wind and thunder.\n\nThe house of Yun has long since established itself in Liyue as a family of craftsmen. At the time of this bow's inception, the seventh head of the house, Hui, was well-renowned as a member of the Qixing.\nYun Hui had but one child, a daughter, by the name of Huang. As per familial custom, should she marry, her husband would take over as head of house.\nHaving been raised an unyielding martial artist, Huang refused to take this path, and instead took over as the daughter she was, inciting endless gossip amongst the people.\nBut Yun Huang took control at a hard time.\n\nThe continent was troubled. Even the loftiest of peaks and deepest of caves collapsed to a symphony of low roars.\nThe bounty of the earth beneath them became almost unreachable, threatening to bring an end to the legacy of their craft.\nOne night Yun Huang lay awake unable to sleep, tortured by her worries that her family's name would end with her.\nAmidst the sorrow that enveloped her, she could do naught but call upon the heavens and pray for celestial intervention in her desperate situation.\n\nIt was then that Han Ce, who had long since abandoned his family business and wandered the continent, arrived in the village in his craftsman's attire.\nHe handed Huang a small wooden box, within which were the prototype plans his father had revised in his later years. He also took out a bow and said:\n\"As the issue arose from Blackcliff, so too shall it end by Blackcliff. It is said that the house of Yun appreciates archery. Should it please you, give this bow a try.\"\nHuang fired an arrow into the sky. It roared across the heavens like angry thunder, as the sound of the bowstring being released reverberated throughout the mountains.\nAs she watched the clouds flow beneath the moon, she knew that her prayer had been answered.",

For it is not merely a weapon, but the culmination of the wisdom of a foreign kingdom.\n\nMade by a foreign scholar, this compound bow has been modified with a pulley.\nThe scholar had no heart for violence, and bore no desire to see blood drawn.\nBut mesmerized by the curve of the drawn bow, and the quiver of arrows in flight,\nHe was driven to transform the compound bow and make it more powerful.\n\nThe scholar knew from the onset of his endeavor what his creation would become — a tool of war, that would bring nothing but death.\nBut he was lost in his pursuit to perfect both structure and materials,\nAnd there was to be no stopping him as he fled this reality.\n\nThough one day the bow was taken up by a soldier, who promptly shot down a wild goose.\n\"This is the bow I seek\"\nSaid the heartless soldier, commending the weapon in his hands,\nAs the final cry of the bird he had murdered pierced his heart, just as his arrow had pierced the bird's.",

Like a needle, it slips between the gaps in an opponent's armor. Like the powers of music and love, it finds its way past people's defenses.\n\nThe designer of the Crescent Pike was said to be able to visualize the fatal flaws in life itself.\nAs if drawn by some mystical power, the pike would fly from her hand towards her opponents' fatal flaws.\n\"Perhaps all that lives waits willingly for death.\"\nSo thought the designer, who could see that which was fatally undefended in each living thing, yet had no such fatal flaws in her own life.\n\nThen she found music, and through music found love. And in love, she found her own fatal flaw.\nIn the end, the pain of finality, which pierced her heart like a needle, finally brought the witch to a realization:\n\"Fatal flaws are born of a fear of death. Fear of death is born of having things, and people, to care about.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I wish to see him but one more time, that thief who can neither be caught nor killed.\"\n\"Oh, how I wish to hear his song but one more time. If I should survive, I shall certainly treat him—\"",

They're all \"Dodocos,\" and they all look the same, after all! So there's no \"you\" or \"me\" for them at all!\nBut only the red, blazing four-leaf clover can let them know the true meaning of \"Dodoco\" and tell each other apart, thus allowing them to play freely with all their friends!\n...At least, that's what my mom says, and she can do just about aaaanything!\nSo, in order to understand what makes a true \"Dodoco,\" they leave their good friends and go to faraway places to make new good friends and become their \"Dodoco,\" too!\nThey'll see all kinds of nice things, hear all kinds of interesting stuff, meet lots of friends... and one day, when their friends are looking at them, at a time when no one expects it — that's when the blazing, sparkling four-leaf clover will appear!\n\nAnd that's why when a furry Dodoco from the Golden Apple Archipelago tumbles into the sea or leaps into the wind before drifting far, far away, that means that a lucky child is about to meet their bestest friend ever!\nThis small, precious book was given by the freest mother in the world to the luckiest daughter in the world. It chronicles the countless adventures that Dodoco had before meeting her, and the adventures that she and Dodoco have had since — bigger and better adventures filled with sparks, splashes, treasures, and lots of friends!",

When Huang frantically declined, Yun said this with a smile:\n\"This pearl is nature's very quintessence. Only one whose heart is clear can use it.\"\n\nThanking Yun, Huang took the Eye and wore it on his person, and slowly made his way towards Liyue. Along the way, neither rain nor wind impeded him.\nAs one who sought after the path of the adepti, Huang wandered the lands without rest. Thus, he would often be at the market to buy water and food.\nThe harbor-side streets were a morass of humanity. Yet Huang walked among them as if idle, and was never taken advantage of.\nSome were curious: how could this bookish exorcist take to the city like a fish to water, and never miss a step?\nWhen asked, he replied: \"This Eye trembles at wickedness, and helps me see which hearts are true.\"\n\nThis Eye could reveal human hearts, though no one knows how it worked, causing many to fall back on folktales to explain it.\nSome say that at midnight, you can dimly hear it call out like a mild breeze, or like spring water flowing between scattered stones.\nBoth are reminiscent of the murmuring of demons that feed on wicked thoughts, a common feature of the parables once told by mothers to their children in days gone by.",

My blood knows no fear.\"\n\"With so many Millelith willingly heading towards their doom in battle, it would be shameful for us mountain people to just stand by and watch.\"\n\"It may be natural that a cataclysm that we have not yet seen with our own eyes remains a foreign and abstract concept to us.\"\n\"Yet now that it stands before us, how could we do anything other than hold the line and do our duty...\"\n\nThe stubborn young woman stole the bow that belonged to her father, the tribal chief, by night, before following the Millelith as they sallied out.\nAs she steeled herself to never again see the light of day, the gem on the bow gleamed.\n\n\"The dark bats she felled with every shot, the giant tortoise of the dark ooze, she nailed to the ground.\"\n\"The magnificent bow danced like the clouds themselves, its arrows' cold gleam tearing through blighted beast-flesh.\"\n\"No deluge of filth from the abyss, nor twisted demon from the warped depths...\"\n\"No incomprehensible terror could make her heart quail, or force her to retreat.\"\n\nThe people of the mountains would sing songs in praise of their daughter, though she of whom the songs spoke would never again return to them.\nThese tunes would change and shift with the passage of time like dawn's glow even to this day, yet she who owned the bow would never come back.\n\n\"The only thing I truly fear is to be lost and forgotten.\"\n\"Should ill fate dictate that I am to be buried in some nameless place, do not forget me.\"",

Only that which is committed to the page may sparkle and shine for eternity.\n\nEven so, the scale of the library's collection is now a fraction of what it was at its peak.\nFor sadly, the library once burned down in the \"Great Fire of Fall Equinox\" tragedy.\n\nThere is a large sturdy door made of poplar wood in the library basement.\nIt is said the door predates the founding of the library and stood firm against the smoke and flames.\nThe truth is this door stood there long before the Knights of Favonius was ever founded.\nThe Knights of Favonius officially states that the restricted section of the library is housed behind the door.\nBut tales tell of a far more profound secret hidden within.",

It is usually only issued after the approval of both the Grand Master and the Church.\nThe craftsmen in Mondstadt have achieved some results in elemental affinity by studying the ancient artifacts of Mondstadt.\nThis heavy greatsword is not only an honor bestowed upon a Knight of Favonius, but also the fruit of the hard work and skills of the guardians of Mondstadt.\nIt can channel elemental power with ease. Its bearer would do well to remember that destruction is but a means to an end, the end being to defend that which must be defended.\n\nOnly a single-handed form of Rostam the Wolf Pup's Favonius Bladework survives today.\nAnother form has been lost to history: that of Arundolyn, the Lion of Light, who could wield both a longsword and greatsword together in battle.\nBecause of the great strength needed, only those gifted with extraordinary strength could attempt this form. Thus, it soon died out.\n\nClose companions growing up, Arundolyn was from a long line of knights while Rostam was born to a peasant family.\nTheir childhood friendship was forged from a shared dream of heroism. As young men, they became fellow knights; as mature adults, one became Grand Master and the other his assistant.\n\nGrand Master Arundolyn was no Vision bearer. His formidable strength came from a mixture of natural gifts and intense training.\nThe Grand Master's strength was his pride, and the Grand Master was the pride of the Knights — nay, the pride of all in Mondstadt.\nAfter Rostam met his fate, Arundolyn never displayed his strength again. For no longer was it a source of glory to challenge ferocious monsters.",

It is used in a ceremonial role at parades and reviews, but it is also a keen and mortal foe of monsters.\nBy studying the arbor that held firm in the wind, the craftsmen and scholars of Mondstadt would learn much of elemental affinities.\nThis sturdy spear not only holds a place of special honor among the Knights — it is also a crystallization of the hard work and artistry of the city's defenders.\nWith it in hand, they shall always remember to be disciplined, and to defend Mondstadt's freedom.\n\nIndeed, many people have used polearms of a kind as their weapons, using the reach advantage to supplement their lack of martial skill.\nEven untrained plebeians could arm themselves with sharpened wooden sticks, and they would perhaps be a match for the steel of trained soldiers.\nTo celebrate the overthrow of the aristocracy, long stakes, flagpoles and pitchforks were stuck all over the greenery around the city.\n\nIt was once required of all nobles to study the art of the sword, that they might grow in stature and wisdom.\nIn those days, the art of the spear was reserved for foreign gladiators and traitors.\nBut there was once a noble scion who wielded a spear.\nThey said that Eberhart would enjoy the night breeze as he caught the first drops of dew with his spear tip.\n\nAn illegitimate child, Eberhart dreamed of recapturing the glory and pride of ancient nobility.\nYet, he needed greater power in order to destroy these rotten foundations. So—\nWhether it was instigate his legitimate brother to pursue his dream of becoming a phantom thief, before deceiving him and forcing him to flee,\nSo that he might usurp that legitimacy,\nOr whether it was pledging himself as a certain spear-wielding witch's disciple to learn the fatal loophole in her art,\nAll the better to slay her with...\n\n\"So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals.\"",

Its bearer would do well to remember that its sharp blade is intended for defending, not attacking.\n\nThe traditional art of Favonius Bladework was originated by the childhood friend and spiritual counterpart of Arundolyn, the Lion of Light, whose name was Rostam, the Wolf Pup.\nLegend says he could chop each drop of rain out of the sky, and that the wind from his sword dance could split the rose and extinguish the torch.\nIn this lies the essence of Favonius Bladework: light, swift, and precise in the defense of Mondstadt.\n\nAt age twenty-seven, Rostam received the title of Wolf Pup.\nKnights of Favonius tradition dictated that the titles of Lion and Wolf were reserved for those of great leadership potential.\nSuch individuals would one day assume the position of Grand Master, devoting themselves to the leadership of a multitude of knights and the safeguarding of Mondstadt.\nBut though he fulfilled his duties faithfully, and devoted himself to Mondstadt, Rostam would not live to see that day.\n\nSince Rostam introduced the bladework style, no other practitioner has ever matched his legendary ability.\nBut his fervor, along with his will to protect Mondstadt, have stayed with the knights throughout the generations.",

Its expertise was gone, though its structure and name have been preserved.\nNevertheless, there are still those who work tirelessly to maintain the dignity of the Outrider title.",

And as he wandered through his own territory,\nThe birds and beasts that depended on the jungle would bow their heads as he passed by to show their respect and reverence.\n\nAll Kings had their own palaces: as each successive king of the forest took the throne, the forest changed according to his image and vision.\nThe palace of the last king of the forest was hidden behind a fence of trees and vines, and beyond a network of water and cliffs,\nIt is the disc of pearls made by moonlight through leaves on still water. The king was at the water's edge, basking in the twice and much moonlight all by himself.\n\nThus did the forest maze come about. Legend has it that the forest king traced the path of a maze in his dazzling dappled stripes.\nEach generation of Kings' palaces piled on top of each other so that the paths would intertwine from tree to tree. Streams would break off or would give birth to new branches,\nThe forest paths growing ever more complex. Only the forest king, we Aranara, and the people from the king tree's sanctuary,\nCould freely go into the forest king's sanctuary and find their own way from tree to tree and stream to stream.\n\n...\nLater, the last king of the forest died protecting the forest. The forest would make no new palace, and the maze would disappear henceforth.\nOr perhaps it was a dark herd of beasts that, like a hurricane, brought down the trees like waves of wheat. Either way, the maze was dead, and so was the forest king.\n\nThe Aranara, who gave me this story, was very timid and did not want us to hear him sing, always seeking a place of solitude.\nOne night, he went through a maze in the forest, and found a bright reflection of the moon in the water. Thus did he hear the story of the last king of the forest. \nThen the current changed and the moon's reflection was scattered. Much has changed, and yet, much still remains the same.\nBut even if you, like me, have never met a king, you would still get the impression that Tiger was a noble and powerful king of the forest.",

Moonlight no longer waltzed through the leaves to cast itself onto the grass, turning the dew into glimmering pearls.\n\nTrees were thrust down to the ground like wheat overwhelmed by strong winds. Every inch of the land was swamped by grief.\nThe grief was so formidably immense and intense that even the streams were fraught with the pungent odor of salt and iron.\n\nOur creator, Queen Aranyani, trusted us with the forest. We thus embarked upon the battles against the monsters that emerged from the darkness, colossi made of iron and steel, and Marana.\nShe entered the desert with the forest's children. They burnt the roots of disaster and tore the branches of calamity, but only a few of them eventually made it back to the embrace of the shade of trees.\nWe lost Vanarana, and too many Aranara returned to the ground before their time. Even the story that survived was bitter and agonizing.\n\nBut we defeated the calamity in the end. Even in the deepest sea of sand, the lotuses still bloomed.\nShe who created us had once again created new life to mend the land's hollowed heart.\n\n...\nCourage and strength still ring out amidst the most bitter of tales. No story is as powerful as \"memories,\" but they empower nevertheless.\nI will cherish the stories you handed to me, stories of our adventure.

We clear about that?\"\nHe nodded, flustered. Then the woman suddenly clapped her hands together and smiled broadly.\n\"Right, silly me! You're a good friend, a real keeper of secrets!\"\n\n\"I suppose it is as they say: one who leans into the drink is themselves not to be leaned on too much.\"\n\"But now that I think about it, I should still have accepted her offer to drink together...\"\n\nThe \"Anthology\" also speaks of the differences in form between the Geppaku Futsu blades.\nThe one forged by Futsu Minori was as gently beauteous as the ocean at night, and thus was named \"Hasui.\"\nThe one made by mute Masayoshi was formidable as the driving hurricane, and was thus called \"Haran.\"",

                    "story": "This item was supposed to be a product sample of a pre-order special for the final volume of King of Invokations #1.\nHowever, due to its unique specifications, the request to produce a sample was misunderstood as one to craft an actual weapon.\nAs such, the editors of Yae Publishing House were frustrated at what transpired upon receiving this bow. Yet Fukumoto, who was present when the bow was delivered, was deeply inspired by this turn of events and wrote the following excerpt, which would later be included in the book as an appendix.\n\n\"The one who wields this bow, shall be the most adept archer under the command of the King of the Great Red Sand.\"\nIt is as everyone said, and a belief that the prussian green-skinned young man held strongly. When the Ibis King displayed his trove of treasures, this bejeweled sandstone-hued longbow caught his eye immediately. It was a time when the young man had yet to be poisoned by destiny, a time when he still believed that all that he desired were accolades to be won—\nTo him, it was a mere matter of how much effort one had to devote.\nThus, he posed a question to the Ibis King with an easy confidence, \"If I become the most brilliant archer of all, if I possess power and strength surpassing that of the other kings, would this longbow be mine?\"\nSilence fell over the court. In the shadows yet to be illuminated by the lamps, no one dared to answer.\nThere was only one exception: the man atop the throne with eyes as sharp as a falcon's chuckled, and granted the young man's wish.\n\"The day is bound to come,\" the green-skinned youth thought.\n\nBe that as it may, long, arduous years have passed since.\nIt was several hundred years later when the lord of war fulfilled his wish. Possessing the young man who opened the Casket of Tomes, he entered the sealed \"Room of Duels\" again, and only then did he see the longbow held by the phantom.\nIt was as if time stood still, so that the remnant of his soul could pass through the shattered doors and scattered corridors, and return to the chamber of treachery and machinations. Grasping the inescapable golden arrow fired off by the Bow of Secret Rites that was zipping towards him, he saved the body from an unfortunate fate of being impaled through the chest.\nThat had always been part of his plan.\nBut at this moment, the secret ritual dissipated. The arrow was dispelled and the silhouette of the bow-wielder vanished in a flash.\nHe grabbed the longbow before it clattered to the ground.\nHis multiple attempts at seizing this gold-forged bow had ended in failure, which contributed to the rift between him and the Ibis King. Alas, when he finally acquired the treasure that he had long coveted, he found that his heart was as cold as a stagnant swamp, with nary a ripple of joy. The Crocodile King pondered, and concluded that he no longer had such a great yearning to satisfy those unfulfilled desires as he did in his youth.\nMoreover, the revered Lord of the Scarlet Sands had been hidden in many histories, and the Mistress of Flowers had never been seen again. In vying for the mausoleum's throne, strife and chaos broke out amongst the kingdoms. Amidst the turmoil, he took the opportunity to trample the sea of sands in the name of the \"Rite of Duels,\" all to erase the barriers between multitude of worlds and thus incite a frenzied war. To stop him, a lone, elderly figure clutching onto the golden bow, trudged up the steps leading to the ritual...\nThose were but memories of a bygone era.\nHe ran his fingers over the orb on the bow, until it dawned on him that it wasn't dust that was dimming its glow, let alone the fact that this dust was a mere figment of his imagination.\n\n\"Never mind,\" the lord of war thought.\nHe heard the sound of the table being activated again in the \"Room of Duels\", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel.\nAnd thus he strapped his longbow to his side, painting a picture of victory he had once dreamed of.\nThe prussian green-skinned king slowly paced towards the battlefield decreed by fate.",

Without these, humans will inevitably annihilate themselves.\"\n\"Witness the silent testimony of the deserted ruins lying betwixt mountain and swamp. Witness the wild beasts in the hills, bereft of their powers of speech and spirit...\"\n\"The people of the past perished without a trace, and even their greatest kings and chiefs failed to make even a ripple.\"\n\nThe people of Chenyu Vale did not always dwell there, but once called the crystal-veined mountains home.\nLife of family and tribe both revolved around the mines, and their settlements stretched from peak to peak.\nBut the ancient sin lying buried beneath their feet and shovels was unknown to the mortals, hidden under the deepest shafts.\nDivine punishment is unforgiving, and cares not for the lives of mortals. After the catastrophe, their forebears were forced to bring their families northward.\n\nThe elders of Qiaoying Village claim that the ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale came from a chasm to the south.\nThey brought with them a great jade altar, and left behind ancient, enigmatic ruins...\nWhen war among the gods brought tragedy, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale's people were reduced to wandering refugees.\nTheir descendents once believed in a now-forgotten god, and all are now lost to history and consigned to dust.\n\n\"An unsound theory,\" responded the consultant in the dark robes, \"the history of mortals is one filled with rebirth.\"\n\"Glory and ruin both spring from mortals themselves. Without agency, there is no rise or fall to speak of.\"\n\"Ancient ruins lie forsaken, but their former inhabitants, buffeted by fate, live on to this day...\"\n\"The fading of their ancestors has given rise to the prosperity of today... even if they are now assimilated, one with the people of a new god.\"\n\"Even if they are often helpless in matters great and small, they have not been destroyed by circumstance, but rather made their own choices.\"\n\"As for the wisdom and laws of the gods, they are based on the consensus of mortals, and not personal whim.\"\n\nAfter a short while, the trivial debate over tea came to an inconclusive end. Such discussions between mortals and gods are wont to end in squabbling over this and that.\nBut the Bishui River flows eternal, just as the luster of the sacred jade within remains as constant as its former master.",

Without hate, they would never know the taste of blood.\"\n\"'Isshin' is the stillness of the mind, free of distractions. This purity of desire empowers the swordsmith to forge tirelessly.\"\n\"But by this token, resentment against living beings is the metal from which a blade that kills shall be forged.\"\n\nIn their frenzied passion to practice \"Isshin,\" the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.\nAs such, the body and mind of the members of the Akame School were often withdrawn and short-spanned, their hearts venomously graven.\nThe blades made by the Akame School were keen indeed, but many of them had some evil within that ultimately led to the school itself being regarded by the authorities as \"undesirable.\"\nFor this reason, the Akame School's position as the leader of the Isshin Art, passed down from Mitsunaga, did not last three generations before being rescinded by the authorities.\n\nAfter that, Akame Kanenaga was involved in the Case of the Eccentric and committed treason.\nThis led him to change his name and leave for a snow-covered nation in the far north, to make a humble living in the land ruled by imperious ice.\nThe only wish of the deceased Kaedehara was to see the Isshin Art celebrated by those who understood a sword's beauty.\nBut the swordsmith, the blade, and the Tatarigami were all tools and titles for people to wield...\n\n\"I spent half of my life in pursuit of the vanity that is the Isshin Art, it only turned out that I became another 'Kaedehara'!\"\n\"Ah, what's done is done. My only hope is that the sword born in the ice and frost will not be as weak as its useless title...\"\n\nThe Kaedehara Clan were master swordsmiths whose works best symbolized Masagomaru's style; whilst the Niwa Clan were humble and diligent, skilled in clay tempering.\nIn their frenzied passion to practice \"Isshin,\" the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.\nAs he passed away amidst the vast snow, the man only wished to forge a renowned blade with which to restore the name of Kaedehara and win back the recognition of the people...",

You know, warming her hands and feet and all. Very great honor.\"\n\n\"Lady Saiguu would later depart, never to return, and those seniors of mine would also be lost due to various other reasons.\"\n\"And that was how someone as bumbling as I took up the role of \"Miko\" and grew into the person you know today.\"\n\"Thus it was in this way that the unfortunate task of putting a smile on Her Excellency's face fell squarely on my shoulders.\"\n\"The night when I first performed the Kagura dance, I felt the weight of the 'past.'\"\n\nThe tinkling of the bells grew distant, and the great silver kitsune, master and friend, disappeared into the winding river of dreams.\nThe bells sounded again, and the obstinate sandbar loosened and dissolved into the swirling current.\nThe pure white, gentle figure of the past had long drifted into dark memory.\nSo the lone daughter of the great kitsune lineage would take up the Kagura bells, and dance for the vibrant \"now.\"\n\nI knew a young and obstinate tengu warrior, and used the pretext of \"training\" to bluff her into asceticism in the mountains,\nBut sensing her unruly nature, I recommended her to those block-headed Kujou.\nAnd though I once had a competition against an obstinate oni and was defeated by dint of sheer perseverance...\nI did add a few little tricks to make our contest more interesting.\nI corresponded with a half-adeptus from a distant land, and gifted her fresh and supple ocean plants.\nStill, I felt keenly that I could not understand her almost foolish love. Is that not a form of bondage for the adepti?\nThe moonlight sweeps across the imperial garden through branch and petal, alighting upon the empty courtyard.\nThat scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart like countless glimmering jewels...\n\n\"In the short span of these few hundred years, I have walked the earth in many guises.\"\n\"Though I have not had the fortune to have deep relationships with ordinary people, I came to know human beauty deeply.\"\n\"And Her Excellency, whom I might dare to call friend, should have more time yet to roam this world.\"\n\"So let us see this imperfect world together and enjoy its obsessions with love and hate, with meetings and partings.\"\n\nWith Her Excellency engrossed in her dream-real of Eternity, someone needed to look out for the common folk.\nTo quell the resentment of the wicked oni Kuroami, I once showed but a hint of the ominous power I wield.\nAnd the great disturbance caused by Kosanta the Bald Tanuki would be made sport of with a little application of magic.\nThe marauding pirate Rinzou, terror of the archipelago, would also be betrayed over some small discordance in plans.\nAnd as for that blank slate, that immortal eccentric...\nI hope \"he\" will find his way and not become a threat to us all.\nThe darkened remains of the swordmaster's soul, the beasts of catastrophe hiding in the sacred forest, they were all wiped out...\nCompared to the dream of Eternity Her Excellency pursues, such things were but fleeting interludes,\nAnd the wait for her to come around seemed to stretch out infinitely, but I knew that time was on our side.\n\n\"I mean, a Euthymia without wind or moon, with lotuses and udumbara that do not wither,\"\n\"I'm sorry, but the loneliness would get to me. I'd be bored to tears.\"\n\"I'd much rather snap off Thunder Sakura branches in a drunken haze and cavort with the impudent youkai.\"\n\"And no, these are not stories of the ancient past, but of a future full of hope.\"\n\"So, You Excellency, might I still have the pleasure of joining you to watch the first pale purple buds that emerge when the snow next melts?\"",

This is destiny's punishment upon me.\"\n\"Become my apprentice. Be my eyes and describe to me the people and things in this gilded desert.\"\n\"I hope to one day weave the poems of heroes into the most beautiful tapestry to exist in the divine courts.\"\n\nCoins are eroded when passed from hand to hand, but noble things become stronger as they change hands.\nHis last owner was a blind poet. Later, the story changed from a tale of a master and a servant to that of a master and apprentice.\n\n\"Before we parted, Mother told me that we would meet again in the eternal oasis...\"\n\"Use this sword as the key to the paradise's gate, and rebuild the kingdom amidst emeralds and pomegranates.\"\n\nHearing the story of the wandering princeling, the aged poet caressed the dull blade of the black sword. At length, he replied:\n\"Thus do our crossed destinies duly end, for I am but a trifle in your epic.\"\n\n\"Master...\"\n\n\"Xiphos, your fate is above those of us humble poets. You should not stoop so low as to write stories for others—\"\n\"You are the one favored by the Jinni. You, who wield the Key of Khaj-Nisut, are the prince of the once-lost kingdom.\"\n\"Embark on your wanderings amongst the failing kingdoms. You shall create new tales and find the eternal oasis...\"\n\"In the times when I wrote hymns for my overlord and love poems for the prince, I fantasized about writing for the hero of destiny.\"\n\"Allow me, please, to recount your epic — the epic of your reunion with your mother and the return of the Lord of Sand's glory to this realm.\"\n\nIn the end, their paths would cross — the crown prince who became a slave and then a hero, and the mercenary who fell from the throne.\n\nMany legends mention a certain key. It is said to have commanded the sands to form a flowing river in mid-air and sealed the homeland after the Lord of Sand parted ways with old friends.\nThey even say that it was used to hide the desert tower and paradise of dreams away under the aegis of illusions when the bubble burst and the nations were scattered.\nThis key was passed between the hands of mortal tyrants and kings, till at last it, too, returned to the sand's embrace.\nAs for the aged blind poet, he would follow the trace of stories and blood-tainted footsteps, and finally find his way to the forest...",

The end.\"\n\nBut this tale belongs to your kind. In your stories, everything always has a deeper meaning.\nI understand that this \"palace\" is everything that makes Cinnamon human:\nOthers who share the same bloodline, a more than spacious living place, common sense, and life lessons — while the King was the wish lurking and glowing in her mind like moonlight.\nYet for us, a palace is a palace, Cinnamon is Cinnamon, the Forest King is the Forest King, and moonlight is just the moonlight.\n\nThe story I heard is at variance with the story of Cinnamon.\nOnce upon a time, there was a child who lost her way in the forest. Following the footprints left by the Forest King, she stepped into the tiger's garden.\n\"Grrrr! Be it birds or beasts, my stomach bids everyone welcome, while the earth awaits their return.\"\n\"I am the king of the forest. I slaughter, and I foster. Only a puny human like you have I yet to sample.\"\nSo said the tiger. However, the child hadn't yet forgotten your language, and naturally, she couldn't understand the King.\n\n\"Grrr,\" the child imitated.\n\nThe Forest King was amused. Usually, when he spoke, your kind would hide in their wooden houses,\nAnd beasts would lie on the ground, not daring to move even an inch, and birds would fly away towards the sun. Even those Rishboland Tigers, mighty as they may appear, would hide themselves in the bushes.\n\"Grrr! A tiny outsider who does not understand etiquette. Alright, then let me teach you all about the forest, and its language you shall learn.\"\n\"From now on, you are my squire. This forest will forever be open to you and all beings here can do harm to you no more.\"\n\n\"Remember, this whole world is but a dream of the forest. One day you shall awake from your reality and find your place in this boundless hunting ground.\"\n\"Where our prey head without fail, we shall arrive at one day as well. Always keep that in mind.\"\n\n...\nThere will always be a new king to inherit the seat from his predecessor. The circle of life applies to you, to us, and to every being in the forest just the same.\nBefore the squire met her fate together with the King, a lost child stumbled into the palace without scrunching a single fallen leaf.\nShe passed on all her knowledge to the child. Just as this story was passed on to me, that child passed on the teachings to the children who came after.\nLater, some children became the guardians of the forest, passing on the forest's language and the responsibility of protecting the King's land to their future successors.\nAnd others, when they gazed upon the great agony others suffered, decided to bid farewell to the hunting ground and become hunters who would terrify even the most vicious beasts.",

Death whispered through the wooded maze, groping for a path to follow.\nFollowing the exile's footsteps, the curse spread across the desert sands to swallow the \"living\" lands.\nThrough jade hallways and pathways narrow, she discovered the intruder's intent from the strangeness of their scent...\nAdrift between memory and ambition, however, the exile was lost amidst the discord of running water and birdsong...\n\n\"You have been struck with one of my arrows, insolent invader! The next shall find its path into your heart.\"\n\"No longer shall you loiter in the forest. No longer shall you disturb the dreams of the children. The crown you seek, you shall not find here!\"\n\nThus did the hale huntress warn her prey, that none yet had ever evaded her arrows or her perspicacity.\nYet, for reasons unknown, she lowered her bow by a few inches and deliberately missed the addled man.\nThe greenery looked on, bewildered, and the dream-hidden children exhaled as blood went unspilled.\nThe slumbering forest king, blessed with insight that can pierce through all dreams, understood her intent and gave a thunderous murmur that caused even the greatest of trees to tremble:\n\n\"That mortal is not alike to you. He comes from a sordid land, and his hands are stained with blood, while his heart festers with delusions and madness.\"\n\"But the forest only keeps dreams wrought from naivete, and blood is only meant to be shed for the hunt or in sacrifice — in this there can be no deception.\"\n\"If you believe that he yet has the potential to reclaim his honor in the maze, then guide him to break off the pale branch...\"\n\"Only then can the bright moon and the newborn stars grant him pure wisdom and help him shed his bitter memories and desires.\"\n\nSo, she again took hold of her pure-white bow and drove the exile, sending him fleeing into the depths of the maze...\nThe truth of what happened afterward was witnessed by the moon and the stars, and only dwells still in the dreams of children.\nSome rumors say that the exiled noble finally used the pale branch to forge a blade that belonged to him and him alone,\nWhile some children claim in their sleep that he forgot the name of his home, and of his dream to be king.\nRegardless, Prince Faramarz's name vanished within the rainforest henceforth, returning to the desert on the back of sand carried by the wind.",

The sharp blade survived, but all that remained of the scabbard was its story.\nFor the sharp blade seeks only to bathe in the blood of its victims, and no sheath can be made that will curb this desire.",

Even if the desert is as cold as ice on long nights, its fiery fate shall never be forgotten.\"\n\"If this is your decision, then please do me a favor, and please allow me to contribute but a little something to this old country that has long since fallen.\"\n\"Just a little revenge shall remove the burden on both our hearts. The one addicted to hunting shall finally be executed by the falcon he spoils.\"\n\"My mother, a Jinni, taught me the seven-fold sword dance. If I win the throne for you, I shall no longer have to flatter others, and that will satisfy me.\"\n\nThe conspiracy to bring down the kingdom was thus drawn up on the bed-mattress, and the gentle words of the lovers were also sharp blades.\nThe tyrant thus returned to the land of searing sands in an ugly fashion, and the great cause of conquering kingdoms and harems finally vanished into thin air.\nThe rise and fall of the city-state were but a drunken dream, during which the kind and the evil alike were crushed by an immense millstone like wheat husks.\nThe concubine adept at her sword-dancing failed to become the queen in the end, and the wise old retainer who survived to tell the story too lost his eyes.\nThe displaced, thrown into the sea of sand by the whirlpool that consumed everything, became wanderers or mercenaries before being engulfed by the forest...",

Or perhaps it is because they are drawn to the romance of sailing away on an adventure.\nLike the ocean, this chart answers to no master. Like the seafarers, it harbors the romantic dream of exploring every corner of the world.",

Every young man's rage at injustice must turn to calm. Every passion must be ground into dust by the march of time, before being turned to wild paranoia upon that inverted, ancient tree. Even the branch of the tree of time upon which the great and glorious Reman Republic nested would be cut off in the end, such that the nation founded by the other twin child of the wolves might rule.\nEverything in this world must pass through the doorway of their destruction unto the future kingdom of the Prinzessin. In the silence of her pitch-dark Nachtgarten would they find a place to slumber.\nEven so, when Droctfult fell at the hands of the Beast of the World, having fought for the dreams of a young man and the rain that had yet to fall, and was torn to shred by its claws, the Prinzessin still began to tear up.\n\n\"Hearken well, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins. The Sovereign of the Immernachtreich weepeth not.\"\nShe went on, \"Who among those born into this world are not burdened with sin? When the clock sounds for the time of judgment once more, the skirt of night shall descend once more. Then, the writhing struggles of man and beast trapped within will be naught but a midnight waltz.\"\n\n\"It is as you say, mein Fräulein.\"\n\"Hmph. As well you should know.\"\n\"Well then, mein Fräulein, I wonder if you still recall this tale...\"\n\nTwo of the three bright moons that caused the perfumed sea of the primordial universe to shine and stirred up the beasts of the Arianrhod Realm were shredded by a sword that tore the horizon asunder, left in smithereens too small even for the mystical sight of the Prinzessin.\nOr perhaps this was what happened: the bright moons that once illuminated a universe, brought dreams and song to the sweet sleepers of three worlds, and awakened a deep longing in the beast-herds that wandered betwixt dawn and dusk — they were at last rendered dust. But even so, they too wished to remain within the eternal, shining gaze of the Prinzessin, bringing their subtle light unto more lands still.\n\nIndeed. A Prinzessin does not shed tears.\nThat was merely a natural secretion from her royal eyes, affronted as they were by the untimely intrusion of those impudent grains of sand.\n\n—Volume End—",

When night came, they would leave the pearl-colored palace to roam the desert, and Nilotpala Lotuses would bloom at their feet.\n\n...\nUltimately, two moon-wheels shattered into dust and disappeared. The last of the sisters was so overcome with sorrow that she would never leave her palace again.\nAfter a long time, the moon debris finally fell to the earth. At that time, the god of vegetation had already brought the forest to the desert lands.\nWhere the dust of the moon fell, the Nilotpala Lotuses bloom. And those children who breathe in the dust will have a pearl-like moon in their hearts.\nThis is why there are always children who are confused by the moon, and the reason why the Nilotpala Lotus blossoms every night, and why the moon always favors these children.\nBecause the three sisters, who mirror each other, long to be reunited.\n\nThe Nilotpala Lotus withered after telling this story. She had waited long — long enough for the desert to become a jungle, and for the great race to be dethroned,\nLong enough for us to appear on the earth, and for the Aranara who told me this story to appear before her and speak to her.\nThat Aranara lost many, many more memories time and time again, until Vanarana was destroyed and we entered a dream.\nBut that is just as well, for the story of the moon will grow into a pearly moon in our hearts as well as yours.\n\nChildren fascinated by the moon will weep when they gaze upon it, for the moon has turned into fine sand and entered their eyes.\nIn countless tales, not a single tear will be in vain.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe disc represents the cosmos and thus takes a circular form. At the center is a piece of Cor Purum, representing a heavenly body suspended in the firmament.\n\nAfter the great chaos subsided, sinister forces still remained in the world. Thus, people abandoned traditional martial arts and tools and espoused the supernatural arts.\nBut the techniques used in catalyst production were antiquated, having remained unchanged in over a century. Thus, the catalysts of that age were fragile and broke on first use.\nThe thaumaturges flocked to Liyue and pleaded with Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun, to design a new type of catalyst for them.\nYun Hui proceeded to add a catalyst to the then-new series of improved weapon designs known as \"the prototypes.\"\n\nThe disc is made of wood and rare ore. The Cor Purum in the center was a gift from the thaumaturges.\nCor Purum is produced by firing Cor Lapis in an urn for seven days squared (that is, forty-nine days) and then steeping it in fresh water drawn from a mountain spring for a further seven days squared.\nThe dual purification of fire and water renders Cor Purum unbreakable, and the thaumaturges also believe it allows the stone to act as a vessel for primordial cosmic energy. A catalyst with Cor Purum at its core can channel cosmic energy with the turning of the disc. Twelve full turns works the energy into its purest form.\n\nYun Hui observed that the Cor Purum had a warm, golden glow like that of amber. After discussion with the thaumaturges, he proposed to name the catalyst \"Prototype Amber.\"\nThereafter, all catalysts made in Liyue were modeled on Yun Hui's prototype.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nWeighing in at close to forty pounds, this weapon's hilt is made from a rare ore, while the blade is forged from the finest steel. All you will see when it is swung are blinding flashes of light, powerful enough to devour the clouds and blot out the moon.\n\nAfter the great disaster, the Yun family forge joined forces with master craftsman Han Wu to find a way to push past the constraints of contemporary blade design and revolutionize their craft.\nThus was born a new series of weapon models, simply named \"the prototypes.\" The first greatsword built using the new design was unusually understated in its final appearance.\nThe underwhelming sight of dull, blotchy gold masked the weapon's true strength. While not much to look at, any who cared to try it would discover that it was weighty but not unwieldy.\n\nHan Wu, the master craftsman who forged the weapon, traveled north through the night to hand the sword over to a martial artist who followed the chivalric code.\nThe martial artist inspected the blade closely before trialing it. The blade howled like the wind and in an instant decimated the entire bamboo forest. It was a rare sight to behold.\n\nThe martial artist said to Han Wu, \"This blade is endowed with the elegance of antiquity. It is of equal value both as a weapon and an ornament.\"\n\"Such a fine creation possessed of both scale and subtlety is worthy of a prestigious name. May it be known as Archaic.\"\nDue to its unparalleled strength, this sword subsequently became the model for thousands of greatswords in Liyue.",

In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss.\nThe result is a beautifully superior bow, sturdy and easy to grip, and cool to the touch.\nThe bow's arc is as beautiful as the crescent moon, albeit a darker shade, like a light moon hanging low amidst a foggy night sky.\nWhen an arrow from the bow pierces the sky, the string's light is thin and cold, reminiscent of an unforgettable moonflow.\n\nThis resemblance has earned the bow the title of \"Crescent.\"\nShould its beauty captivate the people, then Liyue will be sure to see no shortage of similarly-inspired bows.",

With the combined expertise from both sides, Han Wu drew up designs for a new series of weapons, simply named \"the prototypes.\"\nThe very first sword made following this design already had the feel of a formidable weapon.\n\nWhile trying out the sword at Mt. Tianheng, Han Wu accidentally dropped it on the ground.\nThe sword responded by unleashing a swirling tornado of energy that cut a twelve-inch-deep hole into the solid mountain rock.\nHan Wu took it as a sign from the heavens. He declared, \"This sword shall be named Rancour, destroyer of rocks.\"\n\nThis sword shakes mountains at their foundations and possesses the power of a thousand peaks in its tip.\nThis sword that cuts through rocks like butter became the basis for all subsequent swords made in Liyue.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe pole is made of black steel inlaid with gold. A lightning motif runs along the body, featuring streaks of lightning interspersed with stars. The addition of gold leaf gives it an exquisite finish.\n\nBy the time the monster threat was quelled, the remaining troops were few and far between, and each joined the civilian community where they were based. Though peace now prevailed, it sparked a martial arts renaissance that spread throughout the land.\nDemand for all kinds of weaponry spiked, especially for superior quality items, and manufacturers could not keep pace. To find a solution, Yun Hui of the house of Yun met with master craftsman Han Wu and the two conducted intensive research behind closed doors.\nBy the time they emerged, both men's beards had grown by twelve inches. Their new weapon designs, \"the prototypes,\" were finally ready to revolutionize weaponry manufacturing in Liyue. It was time to do away with the shackles of the past that plagued their craft.\n\nThe first pole built to the new specifications had a black-and-gold appearance. The spike at the tip was two inches longer than the previous standard. It was truly a deadly weapon, but one with a composed and commanding presence.\nIt was left to bask overnight in the moonlight. At the first light of dawn, the tip shone with the cold, piercing light of a star against the dim sky.\n\nAt this ethereal sight, Yun Hui's mind was flooded with memories of his father's glory, for his father's name made reference to the stars. Greatly moved, he decided to dedicate the weapon to his father's memory.\nFor this reason the weapon became known as \"Starglitter\" among later practitioners of the halberd arts in Liyue.",

Weightless, like the light that pierces light.\"\n\"Untouchable, moving like a snake. Inescapable, as sword's stare and polearm's glance.\"\n\nThe Rainslasher was named out of reverence for its master. Originally it had no name.\nThe blade's first and final master was a martial nomad who went by the name of Guhua.\n\nIt is said that he was an adeptus. While Guhua lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city.\nAllegedly, at the end of his journey he ascended in a purple haze and became a star.\n\nOne to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. But no school is destined to last forever.",

Yougou,\nFeared the ominous power of the Pestle, and would not come forth to face the Lion King!\n\n...Of course, the children never believed such tales.\nStill, the Otogi King truly was very strong. Even seven men together could not push him out of a dohyou.\nAnd when he saw children hankering after fruit they could not reach, he would kick the tree and send the melons plummeting down.\nThat said, he did once kick the whole tree down, and was chased into the mountains by an old man.\nHe also once brought the children to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert,\nCrying in a loud voice \"The Otogi Kongou Lion King is here. Demons beware!\"\nHe then wrestled with the petite oni who just happened to be in the mood for a tussle... The results were too tragic to watch.\n\nBut if this was all the King had, to the point where he was never given the right to wear the Shogun's colors,\nHow could he, the children said, possibly bring those youkai of song to heel?\n\n\"Hah! I was just suffering from the chills after a long night of drinking, that's all!\"\nEven as the Otogi King made his excuses, he did not forget to laugh heartily.\nWas he just shameless, or did he really believe that he could win? No one could say...\n\n\"This time, I'll definitely cut off the horns of those monsters,\"\n\"And bring them back for ya. That'll show you the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King!\"\n\"Those creatures from beyond the ocean? Pfft! Easy pickings, I tell ya!\"\n\n\"So yeah, shoo, shoo, follow the fox envoy to go hide in a corner and stuff.\"\n\"I'll swing by later. We'll have ourselves a few wrestling bouts then, eh?\"\n\nEven as he said that, the children remembered how the dainty oni had huffed softly,\nHurling the roaring, onrushing Otogi King into the sky...\n\nLater, the oni who had wrestled with the Otogi King would flee after having her arm and horn cut off,\nWhile the Great Tengu would no longer appear before humans, living in hermitage in the mountains and woods.\nAnd so, the empty boasts behind this greatsword came true in the end,\nThough the wandering, eccentric Otogi Kongou Lion King himself never returned again.\nEven later on, the Lavender Melon tree that he kicked down would, with careful tending, once again bear fruit.",

Look after me, my friends, my countrymen, and my opponent. May the sound of clashing blades delight you, and may the offering of sweat and blood please you.\"\n\"O winds that guide my path. When I'm exhausted, bless me with the strength to keep going forward. When I'm uncertain, bless me with the wisdom to distinguish good from evil.\"",

It bore an oath of protection to Mondstadt that they had sworn.\nOver the years, the Lawrence Clan forsook the noble aspirations of their forebears, and the statue was taken down.\nThe wise mages of the court spoke neither of history nor of the oath ever again.\n\nIn the age of the Knights of Favonius, the statue was rebuilt.\nBut the wording of the oath on the inscription was lost forever.",

Gradually, their view of themselves shifted from conquerors, to overlords, to kings.\nGradually, they strayed onto the path of depravity, and lost the affection of Mondstadt's winds.",

Mondstadt was engulfed in blizzards, and the snow stung like sand.\nA group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east. There, they prayed for divine mercy and protection.\n\nThe wind blows for a moment, but the ravages of time are constant, unrelenting and irreversible.\nA god of the winds may move between the pages of a book, but in the end the merciless god of time will eat away at them until not a single legible word remains.\n\nYet, time's assault and that of the wind often take their toll the same upon the heart.\nPerhaps that is why later generations presumed the shrine to have always been to the wind, and the wind alone.",

What mattered was to roar, loud and clear, in the heat of bloody battle. That was duty fulfilled.\n\nSuch hot blood running through the veins should not have been conducive to a long history for the Imunlaukr Clan.\nFor their fight was one without end, and without hope of victory.\nAnd yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last.",

When people questioned him, he laughed and said:\n\"I know myself. What is wine and song to me? Worry not. Once the sea and winds are right...\"\nBut he would never finish that statement. He would only raise his mug, and call for all around to have another drink.\n\nThen, the day when the sea and winds came together arrived at last, and the stern of the great vessel rode them as it sailed.\nDeep into the misty sea it went, far across the darkening waves, into the ocean that teemed with sea creatures.\nAnd at last, neither the singing skipper nor his ship would ever return to the harbor ringed by mountains.\nAfter many days, the corpse of a sea monster from the deep was beached upon the shore by the waves.\nBrilliant white bone shone out from a great gash torn into it by a greatsword. Its blood had long been washed clean.\n\n\"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song.\"\n\"So what if I sleep with the fishes? That way, I will be able to send my sea shanties into the deep where she dwells.\"\n\nToday, the seas are no longer plagued by giant creatures that emerge from the storm and rain down devastation upon the waves.\nThe practice of mounting skeletons of sea monsters onto the bows of ships has also been lost with their extinction.\nBut when one sails far abroad, sometimes one can still hear the spine-chilling sound of thunder rumbling in the depths...",

Certain drawings and odes were missing in the copies that survived.\nHowever, the knowledge passed on in the form of ballads and legends among the general public.\n\nThe histories of the thousand winds were not lost, for Barbatos still holds them.\nWhen Barbatos stood against the shadowy wings of the evil dragon Durin,\nHe sang to the thousand winds and called upon the Wind Dragon.\nHe who holds this atlas wields the true names of the thousand winds and all of their powers.\n\nNow the skies above Mondstadt are calm and blue.\nBarbatos and Dvalin have found a new place to call home.\nThe atlas, meanwhile, has been entrusted to one worthy of the honor.",

Your likeness will forever remain on this wall.\"\n\"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone, I will wait for you, and pray for your return...\"\n\nWhen the daughter of that snow-entombed city withered together with the grafted yet barren silver branches,\nThe outlander destined to wield this sword to shatter ice and snow alike was far afield, chasing answers.\nBright as the moonlight though she was, her final words, too, would never reach that wayfarer.\n\n\"It's been a while since I last saw the blue sky and green grass. I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for.\"\n\"I wish I could see you again...\"\n\nThis was the answer he found—\n\nThe hero ended his fruitless journey at last.\nTainted black blood dripped from the blade of his greatsword,\nAs he trudged through now-foreign snowy paths.\nBut when he returned to the great hall of that mountain country,\nNaught but ringing deathly echoes welcomed him.\n\n\"So even here, there is nothing left for me to protect...\"\n\"You who dwell in the heavens, you must wish for naught but to watch our ashen suffering here below.\"\n\"In that case, then let me help you pass the time with a song of iron and blood.\"\nThe outlander left the Starsilver originally meant to shatter snow and wind alike between the frescoes.\nThen, he descended the mountain to search for a land full of war and strife — a place he might paint red with blood.",

Now released from its container, it shines evermore.\nIn the hands of a truly knowledgeable sage, perhaps its extraordinary power would finally be unleashed after lying dormant for millennia.\n\nA story that has long been popular with the jewelers of Liyue holds that the master craftsman Kunwu once took the light of the heavenly bodies and sealed it in a wooden box.\nKunwu then buried that box deep inside a dark, rocky chamber, where it remained in pitch blackness for forty-nine days and twenty hours, till finally the pearl within had absorbed the shine of the sun and moon.\n\nA most bizarre tale indeed. And yet, to this day, many in Liyue hold steadfastly to their belief in the esoteric talents of the master craftsman Kunwu.\nSomeone once plucked up the courage to ask the aging craftsman what his secret was. The eccentric old man laughed off the nonsensical notion of his mystical capabilities:\n\"Pfft! 'Twas purely the product of prolonged polishing!\"\n\nBut his apprentice revealed a different story when asked about it in private: Just as Kunwu finished polishing the Solar Pearl, the splendor of the heavens shone down and a crimson moon filled the sky.\nBut did this phenomenon mean that Kunwu had indeed received divine assistance in his craft? Or was it a measure of his own accomplishment that his lofty ambitions had sufficed to send waves through the firmament and even elicit a response from the heavenly bodies?",

With it, you shall repel every demon.\"\n\nSo the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure.\nThose who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity,\nThey shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts.\nAs for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a lovely butterfly.\n\nThough these rites have been forgotten over time and with the coming of peace,\nThose with fire in their hearts can still hear these whispered words from flickering flames when they find themselves faced with an imposing darkness:\n\"Only an unbound flame can purify this world.\"",

She once described the night sky adorned with three bright moons to me in a language I have now forgotten — yes, the number of moons should be three.\nMay the shadows of the world cast their pearly shimmer upon the earth when they awake, such that people can follow the silver-plated outline of the dunes at night to find their final fate.\n\nNext, weight was created. Thus sand sank, forming the earth. And that which was without weight became the sky. I stipulated that one should rely on the earth, but dream of the sky.\nThe weight should not be excessive, or the land will bind people's feet, impede those longing to travel far, and hinder expansion through exploration, while causing people to be unable to fly high, unable to explore the future.\n\nThen the seven sage monks were established again, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars. Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion, myths are often born when people look up at the stars and moons.\n\nIn the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the dark poison had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the spikes descended and pierced through the earth's crust.\nHowever, the rules I have set are more elegant and precise, so there is no need and there should be no followers of hers who shall die meaninglessly on their account, and no poetry should be lost for their sake.\n\nNext, the beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak...\nThe wind arises in the new world. The pearly moonlight, the amber afterglow, the waves of grass, and the roots of the waters have gradually ceased to be silent, all singing the poems that she left behind.\n\n...\n\nThe cycle of seven must be removed, because the secret narrative will be blocked.\nFear and grief must be torn down, and so the barrier between life and death must be removed.\nRemove the sun, the moons, and weight, for there should be no barriers between time and space.\nRemove the original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace, so that she will no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on her kin.\nRemove birds, beasts, fish, dragons, humans, and seven monk-kings, so that none shall steal wisdom.\n\n...\n\n\"The Sand King sleeps alone in secret dreams, drawing up new theorems.\"\n\"None shall have to drink salt water in the King's realm, for everything in the new world shall be good.\"\n\n...\n\nThis is how perfection can be achieved. I can see the three of us debating in our paradise once more. We are so close.\nYes, this is splendid. I understand now. This is what I have always wanted. That which I have always longed to find once more has never been a paradise for the many.\nAll the parodies of the teachings and the seven wise monks, or that so-called pure world free of all sorrows, none of those things matter anymore...\n\nBut I do not wish that the poison ingested by mistake should remain in this world. Perhaps she might, in light of our old friendship...\n— Even if she will not do it for my sake, that is also fine. I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend...",

It can only be a sword.\nIf nothing else, it shall bear the memory of those who faced their ends without fear...\n\nWhen you wield this sword, you search for the answers hidden within this world.\nIn this world, such a weapon may be used without any problem.\nNot for the fact that the universe casts no shadows here, and certainly not simply because it suits this world's aesthetics...\nBut because this search is perhaps why you descended to this realm in the first place.\n\nWhen the past is dust, and the future arrives,\nAs the present fades away, you can trust to this blade's edge.\nHaving a weapon for self-defense is, of course, a good idea. After all, this one was forged for one such as yourself.\nSomeone who challenges and pursues.\nTake it, walk this earth,\n\nAnd cut open all the challenges and mysteries that it has to offer you.",

The gears have rusted because of this.\nEven so, it still makes a lethal weapon.\n\nOne by the name of Kreuzlied traveled with the Wanderer's Troupe. Once a member of the ruling Lawrence Clan, now a traitor and outcast.\nIn that time, scholars and bards paid no heed to history. For the Aristocracy preferred to remain willfully ignorant of their own moral degeneracy than face history's judgment.\nBut the aristocrats trembled in fear at the sound of this blade as it flew through the air, for it was the toll of the bell of judgment.\n\nIt was not made public what punishment Kreuzlied met with after the failed uprising. This in itself is a testament to his privileged origins.\nLegend says that after being dismissed from office, his desire to continue the legacy of his fellow rebels led him to establish a secret society aimed at bringing down the Aristocracy.\nIt is also said that he gave his full assistance to the enslaved gladiator when she revolted.\n\nIn the past, a popular rumor was that Kreuzlied's secret society was working constantly in the background,\nHelping the Knights of Favonius keep Mondstadt safe through deeds that no knight should ever be party to.\nIt was even said that the Wolf Pup Rostam ran this organization in secret, behind the Grand Master's back.",

Where the music from this instrument leads, death shall surely follow.\n\nAfter the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded, the harp's strings were cut with a dull blade, creating ear-piercing noises.\nOnly the bowstring now remains. The instrument's lofty melodies are lost, but it remains a deadly weapon.\n\nThe Wanderer's Troupe could make birds fall from the sky, sometimes with the tune of the harp, sometimes with the arrows that followed the tune through the air.\nJust like the wind that elopes with the harp's tune and the flowers that grow on Starsnatch Cliff, the harpist was both playful and determined.\nAfter the uprising failed, the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded and its members fled.\nThe harpist stayed till the end, deftly plucking the instrument's strings and raining down a torrent of arrows to protect his comrades. He played till he exhausted his repertoire, and his arrows.\n\nThe harpist was from the magnificent and enchanting land of Fontaine. He had left to travel the world in search of his true destiny.\nIt is said that all the ladies of the Court of Fontaine wailed with grief when they heard the tragic news that he had left without saying goodbye.\n\nThe story is that he fell in love with a humble Mondstadt woman, but she was then selected for the miserable fate of Ludi Harpastum princess.\nIt is claimed that he had no regrets about dying anonymously in a foreign land.\nThe only thing he regretted was finally discovering true love, only to never have the chance to sing another love song.",

As long as we follow the laws of nature, then we shall not fear death.\"\n\"All those who follow nature, when their life reaches its last ebb, shall head towards that endless plain.\"\n\nFollowing these precepts, the hunter left no traces, and fought not against the natural order.\nShe comforted the wild beasts that had been shot through the heart, until their lives had returned to nature.\nIf that calamity had not happened, if she had not tracked the tainted blood upon the leaves,\nIf she had not met that dying, blind youth under the tree where she often napped,\nThen perhaps she may never have been shaken by thoughts of revenge, by blood and fire...\n\n\"Never forget, good Viridescent.\"\n\"Never forget that you belong to the green, child of the forest.\"\n\"Never loose your arrow for war, for revenge, or for glory.\"\n\"For the bloodstained shall never find yonder hunting fields of endless viridescence.\"\n\n\"Then at least do not let this bow be tainted by my mortal vengeance.\"\n\"I cannot reach the other side, whether to meet my master or the parents whom I have never met.\"\n\"But at least let this bow remain pure, and let it carry my thoughts and regrets to them.\"",

But in the good news, he won that unmatched bow.\n\n\"Behold, Konbumaru, this is Tengu archery. Watch and learn!\"\nHe was given this rather ridiculous nickname, but ultimately, he witnessed the Tengu's form.\nSoaring through the clouds unfettered, unleashing thunderbolts with every bowstring's pulse...\nIt was a true, unreserved dance of death. Fierce and unpredictable, elegant and beautiful.\n\nMany years later, he was no longer a servant boy, and he had grasped both some archery and swordsmanship.\nHe was referred to the Shogunate through a recommendation letter from his impatient master.\nIn the years under the Shogun, his martial skills improved greatly, and he made many friends and enemies.\nStill, his hobby of unrestrained wanderlust had not changed. On the contrary, with the Tengu's great bow, he became yet more fearless.\n\n\"Let's make a wager this time, shall we? Hmm. Right, then. This bow shall be my wager.\"\n\"I bet on the mightiest bow in the world that I will return here alive.\"\n\"I'll leave it here with you for now. If I, Takamine, lose our bet, you can keep the bow.\"\n\"After all, you've inherited the essence of my archery techniques. You'll be able to make good use of it.\"\n\"But if I win...\"\n\nWhen disaster swept in from across the distant sea, the samurai and the obstinate shrine maiden had a mutual wager.\nThey bet on his safe return from the abyss against the inscribed bow bestowed by the Shogun.\n\nWhen the dark venom sank deep into the earth and peace returned, the swordsman did not come back.\nThe Shogun's bestowed bow was given to the shrine maiden as her prize for winning their great wager.\nLater, in the forest where the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer appear, in the promised meeting place,\nThe lone returnee who came stumbling back from the abyss finally met the shrine maiden again, though by now she could no longer be called young.\nDull eyes stained with dried blood and tears regained their radiance, but were pierced through by a barbed arrow glowing with power.",

Whether it be the design of the bamboo handle, the patterns on its surface, or the colors of the oil paper beneath beads of water, the umbrella looks in every way exquisite and delicate. Each time I pass through an alley and see such an umbrella outside a store, I often find my thoughts drifting back to a certain event. Rumor has it that there once was an umbrella that sent the whole town aflutter with activity. Here's how the story goes:\"\n\"Hundreds of years ago, during the season of a grand festival, the flowers were in bloom, the foxes were at play, and even the typically stoic Tengu mingled amongst the people. Yet, the most eye-catching oddity was a girl bearing an intricate umbrella while sipping the fine wine of the Oni Clan. As she grew inspired, the young maiden danced like billowing flowers amidst the snow as the moonlight poured down on her. All who beheld her found themselves cheering her on, be they human or youkai. But with the passage of time, the girl went to war with the army and met a most untimely fate. With her passing, her cherished umbrella was offered to a shrine by her loyal subordinates.\"\n\"A daughter to a prominent martial family encountered the umbrella when offering her prayers at a shrine. Hence, she decided to purchase it at full price. The next day, with the skies wet with rain, the girl wanted to seize the opportunity and venture out with her umbrella. However, before she could even get changed, a message was delivered from afar, informing her of her husband's death in battle. Consumed by grief, the girl fell ill and left this mortal plane to seek her lover within the stretch of days. After her funeral, her parents regarded the umbrella she bought as something of a cursed object and returned it to the shrine to be sealed away.\"\n\"Yet, after a few months, new rumors spread. People would claim that, on rainy nights, a previously unknown youkai would stalk the streets. The way the youkai was illustrated made it sound akin to an umbrella, except taller than a man, bearing a single eye, a single leg, and also a long tongue. Should someone walk alone at night, the youkai may just suddenly appear, using its long tongue to lick those that dare pass by. From the perspective of those who live in Fontaine, the youkai presented little threat with its main acts seeming like pranks. That said, few people actually knew what the youkai's true intentions were. This engendered a sense of worry amongst the people who walked the streets. Young maidens dared not to leave home. The elderly sighed, saying if the wise and powerful were not absent, dealing with this youkai would be a trifling thing. At that moment, however, few even knew how to exorcise such a simple being.\"\n\"Later, when a young Shrine Maiden caught wind of what happened, she took the umbrella out from the shrine, and washed it from the tip down using a wooden spoon. As she used a silk cloth to wipe its surface, she said this:\"\n\"'Even should the rains of yesterday cease, tomorrow and the day after remain. If that noble were still alive, your present state would surely be held unacceptable!'\"\n\"Hence, she had the umbrella enshrined in an annex of the temple. Since then, none have heard either hint or whisper regarding this umbrella again.\"\n\"Now, I heard this story from a friend of mine in Inazuma, although I did go around investigating the shrines around Narukami and found no mention of the umbrella being enshrined. When I told this to my friend, she just laughed:\"\n\"'Truly, Mademoiselle Leucade, do you take these kaidan to be the truth?'\"",

On this night, the stars and lilies belong only to you.\"\n\"Keep my name in your heart, dearest Xiphos, if but only for this night.\"\n\nTo please the waning vassal king, the scholars who ruled Tulaytullah offered tribute,\nAnd Makhaira, a court dancer, found herself as part of that inventory, forced to say farewell to her golden-eyed lover.\nThe stories that follow have been diluted by too many tongues and have been left forgotten by too many minds...\n\nMakhaira claimed her vengeance, bringing low a desert kingdom once thought invincible...\nBut her own life was devoured by an adder, and she was drawn into slumber beneath quilts of gilded sand, never to wake.\nXiphos earned esteem among his kindred, yet died in vain, protecting the nobles who feared him...\nThe Blade of Tulaytullah met his end at the hands of another exiled princeling,\nWhose banishment had been delivered unto him indeed by that serpent-hearted dancer, the daughter of a Jinni.\n\nIn the end, all people, good or evil, will find themselves ground beneath the wheels of fate,\nAnd the sapphire city would fade, dissipating like tears beneath the scorching sun.",

But there is one story that they all believe.\nThey believe that Rex Lapis once wielded a spear that pierced the rainbow, pinning the churning vortex that had once terrorized the oceans in the center of the deep sea.\n\nLegends have it that since then, one can often see dolphins and whales congregate about that patch of ocean, singing.\nSome hold that they mourn for the god that they revered, and sing many a winding dirge for it.\nOthers claim that they do so in awe of Rex Lapis' great power, that he could indeed pierce the rainbow's arc and bring down the sun.\n\nBut folk legend also holds this.\nThat one day, the vortex, consigned to a dead stillness by the Lord of Geo's divine spear, will once again begin to wake.\nWhen the wind once again brings the stench of the depths onshore, that will be the omen of a hurricane as large as a nine-headed hydra.\nWho, then, will be able to subdue That Which Lies in the Deep?",

I would rather accept my fate than die pursuing a falcon.\"",

Its edge flows with the phosphorescence of the depths.\nThe way this person once made the navies of Narukami quail are well-recorded in the island's music.\n\nThe whalesong that the twin Watatsumi shrine maidens once sang followed the tide's flow into the dreams of the island's people.\nAll of Watatsumi's warriors pinned their hopes and will to fight upon their shoulders.\nAnd they brandished their nagamaki like a white, flowing wave, and with a loud shout advanced upon the other islands.\nYet the glory of Omikami and that of his warriors were dimmed by the lightning's glow...\nMouun was consumed by a dark storm of crow feathers, and the great whale who sang with the sisters sank to the bottom of the sea.\nThe vassal ruler, determined as a child, the vanguard of their forces, vanished into a rift rent into the very earth itself.\n\n\"Umigozen\" was lost to the waves, becoming a myth to the archipelago at large.\nSome say that she dove alone into the press of tengu warriors to reclaim the bodies of her comrades, and was lost after a valiant last stand.\nOthers say that she hid thenceforth, steering her flagship into the Dark Sea at the borders of the world...\nThe only proof that she once sought to change the tides of the world is this still-sharp naginata.\n\nAs long as the seas are yet disturbed by the waves, so too might the memory of her song live on.\nLegend even has it that the song yet echoes within seashells and the bellies of mighty whales at the bottom of the sea.",

It is unique in that the edge closest to the wielder has been left dull.\nThe dull edge is said to have been used as the hilt, enabling the wielder to switch forms by constantly shifting hand positions in combat.\n\nThough it is rarely acknowledged, this greatsword was in fact a foreign bladesmith's labor of love.\nThe bladesmith knew himself to be dull of wits, and was anxious that this blade should not follow suit. Hence, he worked painstakingly on sharpening and balancing his beloved blade.\nSparks flew as the bladesmith worked through many sleepless nights.\nThe sword was recast and re-tempered countless times.\nAll the while his mind was consumed with the hope of his lover's return, as well as his untold anxiety for her well-being.\n\n\"After the war is over...\"\nThe bladesmith would ponder briefly, each time he paused for breath.\n\"Will this blade still be of use to her?\"\n\"Will she even make it home safely?\"\nThese thoughts would linger in his mind for but a moment before he cast them aside and refocused his full attention on the blade.\nIndulging irresolvable anxieties was a futile endeavor — better to focus his faculties on creating the perfect welcome-home gift.\n\nFinally, the day came when the triumphant expeditionary force entered the city gates, their monstrous foes defeated at last.\nBut the bladesmith had not had time to carve his lover's name onto the blade's body.\nWith no time to lose, he grabbed the sword and rushed to meet his lover on the occasion of her return.\nUnfortunately, what would transpire next was to be an unbearable anticlimax.\n\nAs the warrior removed her helmet, long, soft hair flowed down. She was growing her hair out, and hence would never need to wield a blade again for the rest of her days.\nMeanwhile, she had brought her lover a gift, too: A shiny new hunting bow.\n\"Romance is dead! I wasted all these years making you this greatsword, and now you don't even need it!\"\nThe bladesmith was thoroughly miserable and would not stop complaining about the unfairness of it all.

One fine day — When? No one can say — he appeared like a ghost in our slum.\"\n\"He sings, he drinks, he wanders the streets, he passes the roofs and terraces by. But everyone knows he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.\"\n\"The sword by his side was a great house's pride, and he stole it from where it'd been lain, and the bow so black that he wears on his back fires never once in vain.\"\n\"His matchless skill rings chill in the night like a comet's flashing tail, and his strides are as light as Favonius' flight, and the leaves that behold him quail.\"\n\"He could slake the entire Cider Lake, were it all filled with Death After Noon. And then he'd creep right up to those pigs at midnight, while they're all fast asleep in their rooms.\"\n\"He robs the rich and pays the poor, he blows noble farts away, he throws a spark into the dark, and night is pierced by day.\"\n\n\"The maidens all dream of the gentleman thief, they pine after him from their windows, but sad to say, he passes not that way, he prefers a pint with his fellows.\"\n\"Till on one day (or was it dusk?) in a mansion he ran amok, took he with him a thief's full due, and an extra silver cup.\"\n\"Left he silently in the moon's silver light, when fey were his eyes set ablaze, he lifted them nigh to a warm window bright, and upon a lovely face he gazed.\"\n\"Her eyes they shone like sapphire stones, so blue did they gleam in the dark, and the thief glanced up to the gem in his cup, and he thought them the same in his heart.\"\n\"Losing no time, the thief made his climb, and prying the gem from its place, he gave it to her, and a bashful smile stirred, and crept up upon her face.\"\n\"When at last they toppled the indolent nobles, they left, distant lands to explore, and so the song says, they warmed each other's days with light forevermore.\"\n\nThe story ends here. In the latter days of righteous governance, there are none left who sing of the gentleman thief, nor are such thieves needed anymore.\nWine and swords, maidens and heroes, a carefree opening and a happy ending, this vulgar sort of tale tends to be popular with the people.\nFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.\nThey give the unfortunate a little courage to face tomorrow, and stand up to the powers that oppress them...",

The pale moon cast its cold light upon the winner and the defeated alike.\n\n\"Whichever direction the wind blows, there is never a single ripple in the cup of life.\"\n\"The three departed goddesses had long determined the heroes' fate, even if they could never fathom it themselves.\"\n\nThe wanderer took the moonlit sword, picked up the bloodstained silver coins, and trod in silence toward the distant rainforest.\nThus deprived of Xiphos' protection, the city lost its luster and withered away in the following years.\nIts buildings and gardens were ground down into the dirt along with its destiny, and then the howling desert gales consigned them to oblivion.\nUltimately, the black key and the young prince's quest to rejuvenate his kingdom both sank into the sand's embrace...",
